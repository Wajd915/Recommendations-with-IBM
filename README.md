# Recommendations-with-IBM



**Building a Recommendation Engine with IBM**

This project is a component of the Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity, in collaboration with IBM. The goal is to develop a recommendation engine that suggests new articles to IBM Watson Community users, enhancing user engagement and content discovery.

**Libraries Used:**
- **Python 3.7 and above**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **Pandas**: Provides data structures and data analysis tools, essential for handling and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Numpy**: A fundamental library for numerical computation, used for efficient array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing data and results.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading data models and results to and from disk.
- **RE**: Regular Expressions library for pattern matching in text data.
- **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit for processing textual data.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: A powerful machine learning library for Python, used for developing and evaluating recommendation models.
- **Jupyter**: An open-source notebook environment for interactive computing and data visualization.

**Overview:**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Before making any recommendations, it’s essential to explore the data to understand its structure, identify key features, handle missing values, and find outliers. Key questions to address include:
     - What are the distribution patterns of user interactions?
     - What are the common user behaviors and article preferences?
     - Are there any potential biases in the data that could affect recommendation quality?
   - Data visualization techniques (such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps) are employed to uncover insights and guide the subsequent modeling process.

2. **Rank-Based Recommendations**
   - In this approach, we recommend the most popular articles based solely on user interactions. The rationale is that articles with the highest engagement (most clicks, likes, or views) are likely to be of interest to new users as well. This provides a starting point for personalized recommendations.
   - The top articles are identified by counting interactions and selecting the most frequently interacted ones.

3. **User-User Based Collaborative Filtering**
   - This method leverages the similarities between users to recommend articles. Users with similar interaction histories (similar items they have interacted with) are identified. These similar users' interaction data are used to predict which articles a given user might like.
   - This approach personalizes recommendations based on the behavior of other similar users, enhancing the quality of the recommendations.
   - The similarity between users is calculated using metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations**
   - Content-based filtering recommends articles based on their features (like tags, title, categories) that match with the user’s known preferences. 
   - It analyzes the content of articles (text, metadata) to identify which articles are relevant to a user's specific interests.
   - This method is effective when there is sufficient content metadata and user preferences can be clearly defined. It reduces the risk of recommending irrelevant content.
   - Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are used to extract important keywords from the article content.

5. **Matrix Factorization**
   - Matrix factorization is a machine learning approach that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors that represent user preferences and article features.
   - This technique predicts the likelihood of interaction between users and articles that they have not yet interacted with. It helps in generating more personalized recommendations.
   - The user-item matrix is factorized into two matrices (user and item matrices) that approximate the interaction data. These matrices are then used to make predictions on unseen data.
   - We also analyze how varying the number of latent features impacts recommendation performance to avoid overfitting.

6. **Recommendations and Evaluation**
   - The final recommendations are generated by combining outputs from different recommendation methods (rank-based, user-user collaborative filtering, content-based, and matrix factorization) to minimize biases and enhance coverage.
   - A/B testing can be performed to compare the effectiveness of individual and combined recommendation systems.
   - Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate recommendation quality.
   - We track user feedback (e.g., clicks, time spent on articles) and use it to iteratively improve the recommendation model.

7. **Future Work**
   - As we gather more data, retraining the SVD model will incorporate more user and article interactions, improving the recommendation quality.
   - Tracking the time spent on articles as a feature can provide insights into user preferences and refine recommendations.
   - Implementing user feedback mechanisms will allow users to rate and comment on recommendations, which can be used to improve the model.
   - Exploring hybrid recommendation approaches that combine multiple recommendation methods to cater to diverse user needs.
